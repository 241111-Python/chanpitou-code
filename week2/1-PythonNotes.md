# Python

    _ interpreted language
    _ user-friendly/simple syntex/ a lot is abstracted/ intuitive - HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGE
        _ no pointers/memory management
        _ Garbage collection
        _ Automatic memory management
    _ Dynamically typed
        _ we don't declare the type
        _ we can use annotations to "suggest" what type to use
    _ Strongly typed - we cannot implicitly coerce a veriable type ("Hello" + 100)
